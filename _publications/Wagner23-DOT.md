Our seminal publication on the use of transformers for speech emotion recognition. Contains insights on fairness, robustness, complementarity between text & audio, and generalization. Associated with the publication of a [model](https://huggingface.co/audeering/wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion-msp-dim) to predict arousal, valence, and dominance.
