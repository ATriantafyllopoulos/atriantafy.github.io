Our quarterly practical course on audio, speech, and language.

Workflow
======
We form groups of 2-3 students and they work under the supervision of a tutor for the duration of the semester (13 weeks). The first few weeks we offer introductory lectures and provide recommended reading. The next weeks are centered on implementation & experiments.

Topic
======
The topic I supervised for our 2025 course was titled "Audio deep reinforcement learning". This was a first attempt to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to audio understanding. The students were given access to an existing (private) repository where an initial prototype had been implemented by me and were asked to extend it.
