excerpt: 'Using speech for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases.'

Broader context
---
The quintessential symbol of a doctor is the stethoscope. This is because *auscultation* offers us an unobtrusive way of monitoring the human body. Nowhere is this more important than when it comes to diseases that affect the upper or lower respiratory tract.

We aim to make the smartphone the modern-era equivalent of the stethoscope. By analyzing speech, we hope to identify whether a person is suffering from a respiratory disease, ranging from short-term infections (COVID-19, flu) to long-term conditions (asthma, COPD).

Current status
---
The majority of our work is done on a small-scale COPD dataset collected at the University of Augsburg (see references below). We have obtained promising results using interpretable features as input to our models. Currently, we are trying to improve the predictive performance of our models by investigating deep learning architectures, as well as expanding our scope by considering additional datasets and diseases.

Open research questions
---
The main open research question in respiratory health are:
* whether we can distinguish between diseases (and not simply whether a person has a disease or is healthy)
* whether speech can detect changes in disease status
* whether we can make models that generalize across different languages
