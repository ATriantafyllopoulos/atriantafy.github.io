I am a doctoral candidate with the School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT) at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by [Prof. Bj√∂rn Schuller](http://schuller.one/). I work as a research assistant for the [Chair of Health Informatics](https://www.kiinformatik.mri.tum.de/en/chichair-health-informatics), which belongs officially to the TUM University Hospital and the TUM School of Medicine & Health, although we have a second affiliation with CIT. Previous to that, I worked as a research assistant for the University of Augsburg and as an AI Researcher for [audEERING](https://www.audeering.com/). I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Patras.


Research
====
My research focuses primarily on speech and audio. My earlier research focused on the recognition of emotions through speech. I now additionally work on the intersection of health with speech, with an emphasis on mental health disorders (MDD, PTSD, ADHD, Stress) and respiratory disorders (COPD, COVID-19, Flu) that impact speech. I also work on general audio understanding, which corresponds to the holistic characterization of soundscapes and their decomposition into their constituent sources.

In terms of machine learning, I am primarily interested in *adaptive* deep learning. This corresponds to models that can accommodate for additional context. In the parlance of large language models, this is known as *in-context* learning; however, I prefer the term *adaptive* as it can be applied to other modalities as well and generalizes beyond *prompt engineering*.


Prospective students

I am accepting applications from prospective students.
